If you've worked in the music business, you know ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC -- these are the three big performance rights organizations.  They manage huge databases of songs, song-writers, and publishers.  If you're doing composition research -- "Who is Adele's publisher?" or "What percentage of 'I Choose You' does Sara Bareilles own?' -- you have to look in three separate places.  Why not search all of these sites at the same time?  Enter Song Search.

Inside of the Song Search Chrome extension, users can enter different combinations of title, composer, publisher, artist, and id information. Song Search launches three new tabs and populates/submits their search forms -- or, where available, navigates to a custom search URL for the site.
